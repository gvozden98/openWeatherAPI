# openWeatherAPI
Simple weather and pollution monitoring app using the OpenWeatherAPI and IQair API. It's a simple and seamless app thats not really nicely done beacuse i intended to use different technologies as the means to practice coding different languages. Some things are done with PHP that shouldn't have been done that way. The app has functionallity to insert user messages into the database and validate the form. The air pollution page is still not done as it lacks some usability and features but will be done shortly.
